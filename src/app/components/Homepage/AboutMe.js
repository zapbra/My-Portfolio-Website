            <p className="mb-2">
                I am a passionate programmer who started coding in high-school
                after taking a beginner programming class.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">
                After graduating, I really enjoyed programming and continued to
                program in my free time. Starting with HTML/CSS, I found it
                incredibly interesting to be able to make a complete website
                with code. I remember looking at some of the (amateurish)
                websites in the course I was following and wishing I could make
                them, but now those websites seem very simple to make.
            </p>

                After becoming quite experienced with web development and
                learning JavaScript and all the frameworks/libraries that go
                along with it (NodeJS, ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, etc)
                I have built some of my own websites and web apps.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">
                In September 2023, I decided to take the Algonquin College
                Computer Programming 2-year course, and I am so glad that I did.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">
                I realized that there was a lot of interesting programming that
                I was missing out on. I learned so many new aspects of
                programming, such as Java development and Object-Oriented
                programming, computer systems and how the hardware works, Linux
                operating system and programming with Bash, design patterns
                (Single Responsibility, Singleton, etc), database programming
                (queries, db administration, user management), and much more.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-2">
                I am very excited to learn more about the computer programming
                field and excited to graduate in April 2025 and get more
                real-world work experience.
